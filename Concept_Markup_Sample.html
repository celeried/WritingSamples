    <h1>Cloudy: An Overview</h1>
    <p><b>Cloudy</b> is a private cloud ecosystem of unique servers and applications. Cloudy provides application deployment flexibility, streamlined hardware resource use, and a common hosting environment.</p>
    <p>Cloudy is equipped with <b>Weather Status</b>, a user interface (UI) solution that enables entry-level admins to maintain Cloudy and its corresponding application load without knowledge of command-line code.</p>
    <p>The Hub 1, Hub 2, and Hub 3 systems provide servers for the Cloudy ecosystem. All systems that contribute servers to Cloudy can run select Cloudy-approved applications. For Cloudy 1.1 <i>(Weather Status Version 2.1)</i>, the Cloudy server contribution and application distribution is as follows:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>System</th>
        <th>Servers Contributed to Cloudy</th>

    <h1>Cloudy Basics: Kubernetes 101</h1>
    <p>Cloudy is based on Kubernetes, a FOSS (Free Open Source Software) Orchestration Tool designed to manage containerized applications across multiple hosts. This means admins can deploy, host, update, and maintain applications and their availability 24/7. For example, if Appy runs on a server that needs maintenance, end users can still experience this application seamlessly during server repairs since the instance of this software can be transferred to an alternate Cloudy server.</p>
    <p>Key terms admins will encounter while interacting with/and or observing Cloudy via Weather Status are defined, below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Cloudy Applications:</b> These are pre-approved applications designated to run within the ecosystem. They can be scheduled to run on any Cloudy worker node.</li>
      <li><b>Node:</b> The terms "node" and "server" can be used interchangeably.</li>
      <li><b>Worker Node:</b> A worker node is a server that provides its resources to Cloudy for application scheduling and hosting.</li>
      <li><b>Cluster:</b> A cluster is a group of servers.</li>
      <li><b>Container:</b> This is an executable image containing software and all its code libraries.</li>
      <li><b>Control Plane Node:</b> A control plane node (aka, an orchestrator node) is a server running an instance of the software library responsible for managing and deploying containers in Cloudy. There are two (2) control plane nodes within Cloudy, indicated by a "C" icon in Weather Status.</li>
      <li><b>Cordon:</b> This action marks a worker node as unusable to the control plane node(s). When a worker node is marked as "cordoned," the control plane node will not schedule applications to run on the designated node.</li>
      <li><b>Drain:</b> This action cordons a worker node and also forces a removal of all applications running on it. Once a worker node has been drained, the control plane node will then attempt to reschedule the applications on another available worker node.</li>
    </ul>
         
    <br></br>

    <h1>Application Priority</h1> 
    <p>When managing applications within Cloudy, the following priority scheme should be taken into account: </p>    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Application</th>
        <th>Priority</th>
        <th>Notes</th>

        <td>Appy</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>This is an essential service. Appy must be maintained 24/7.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Happy</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>This is an essential service. Happy must be maintained 24/7.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chappy</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>This is an optional service. Chappy should be maintained under ideal conditions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Sappy</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>This is an optional service. Sappy should be maintained under ideal conditions.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Flappy</td>
        <td>3</td>
