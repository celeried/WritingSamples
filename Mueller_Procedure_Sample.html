    <h1>Rock Climbing Basics: Tying a Figure Eight Follow-Through Knot</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>The What</h2>
    <p>The figure eight follow-through knot is the most essential and basic knot for beginner and veteran crag hoppers alike. Before approaching any pitch, climbers should make sure they can tie this knot with their eyes shut. <i>(Note, it's still in the best interests of you and everyone involved in your climbing adventures to actually tie in with your eyes open</i>.)</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Why</h2>
    <p>The figure eight follow-through knot is one of the safest knots to climb with since it is the easiest to perform a safety check on.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Essentials</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yourself, equipped with an adequate climbing harness and shoes</li>
            <li>A trusty belay buddy, also wearing a climbing harness and a reliable belay device</li>
            <li>A good rope</li>
            <li>Too much chalk</li>
        </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>The How</h2>
    <p>If you are climbing top-rope (i.e., a predefined route at a gym or outdoor setup), you should be working with the rope closest to the rocks and/or wall. Your belay buddy should be manning the rope that falls away from the crag. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Grab the end of the rope (aka, the working end) with your non-dominant hand and stretch it out to the length of your opposite shoulder in a loose fist with your dominant hand (e.g., if you are right-handed, the rope end should be held in your left hand and stretched to the outside of your right shoulder). </li>
            <li>Drop the working end and hold out the remaining section (aka, a bight) of rope. Create a baloon or loop, with the end of the rope falling to the floor in parallel to the other end connected to the rock or wall.</li>
            <li>With the top of the loop toward the ceiling, twist the baloon one full rotation.</li>
            <li>Gently pass the end of the rope through the loop. Don't tug excessively. You will have your first figure eight.</li>
            <li>Using the end of the rope, attach the figure eight loop to your harness. Guide the end of the rope along the same side of the belay loop, passing it through the lower leg loop and the upper waist loop. The figure eight should sit up against the bottom waist loop of your harness.</li>
            <li>Trace the original figure eight knot with the working end of the rope, threading it through the top.</li> 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Safety Check:</b> A properly tied figure eight follow-through knot should have three sets of parallel strands of rope. Tighten the knot by pulling on the strands diagonal from each other.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>If you accidentally use too much rope, you can form an additional single loop or fisherman's knot with the remaining inches of rope. Confused? Refer to the picture below, curtesy of <a href="https://www.rei.com">REI</a>.</li>

            <li>Double check your work and ask your belay buddy to do the same. You should both check their belay setup as well.</li>
            <li>If all is well, "Climb on!"</li>
        </ol>
